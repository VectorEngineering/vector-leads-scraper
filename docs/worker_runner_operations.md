# Worker Runner Operations

## Overview
The worker runner is a core component of the Vector Leads Scraper service that executes background tasks using Asynq as the task queue system. This document outlines its setup, operations, and maintenance procedures.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Redis**: Task queue management (Asynq)
- **PostgreSQL**: Lead data storage
- **New Relic**: Performance monitoring
- **External APIs**: Data enrichment
- **Notification Systems**: Alerts and updates

### Configuration
```yaml
worker:
  concurrency: 10
  batch_size: 100
  retry_limit: 3
  retry_delay: 5s
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_second: 5
    burst: 10
  monitoring:
    metrics_interval: 1m
    health_check_interval: 30s
```

## Operational Workflows

### 1. Lead Scraping Pipeline
- **Task Scheduling**
  - Executes scheduled scraping tasks from Google Maps
  - Manages batch processing and pagination
  - Coordinates parallel scraping jobs
- **Rate Management**
  - Implements rate limiting and backoff strategies
  - Ensures compliance with service limits

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Data Cleaning & Normalization**
  - Standardizes formats (phone numbers, addresses)
  - Removes duplicates and validates basic information
  - Verifies contacts using email/phone verification services
  - Ensures data accuracy and deliverability
  - Formats data according to specified schemas

- **Data Enrichment**
  - Third-Party Enrichment APIs
    - Clearbit, FullContact, Hunter, ZoomInfo integration
    - Enriches with company details (size, industry, etc.)
    - Adds job titles and professional profiles
  - Social Media Integration
    - LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook API integration
    - Pulls social signals and profile information
    - Adheres to platform-specific permissions
  - Geolocation Services
    - Google Maps API integration
    - Converts addresses to geo-coordinates
    - Enriches with regional data

- **Advanced Data Processing**
  - Custom Data Aggregation
    - Cross-references with historical data
    - Integrates internal database information
    - Fills missing details from existing records
  - Machine Learning Implementation
    - Predicts lead scores based on enriched features
    - Segments leads by conversion likelihood
    - Implements ML algorithms for data analysis
    - Continuously improves prediction models

### 3. Integration Pipeline
- **Data Export & Distribution**
  - Exports processed leads to external systems
  - Generates comprehensive reports and analytics
  - Maintains data format consistency
  - Ensures data quality in exports
- **System Integration**
  - Manages webhook notifications
  - Maintains data pipeline integrity
  - Syncs with integrated services
  - Validates data consistency across systems
  - Monitors integration health

## Best Practices & Guidelines

### Task Design
- Design small, focused tasks
- Implement idempotency
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Maintain task independence

### Resource Management
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement proper cleanup
- Use connection pooling
- Handle rate limiting effectively

### System Monitoring
- Track key performance metrics
- Set up alerting systems
- Monitor queue health
- Track resource utilization

## Maintenance & Operations

### Regular Maintenance
- Clean up old task records
- Archive completed jobs
- Monitor system health
- Update configurations as needed

### Troubleshooting Guide
1. **Task Processing Issues**
   - Check Redis connectivity
   - Verify task payload format
   - Review error logs
   - Validate rate limits

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Check database performance
   - Review concurrent task limits
   - Analyze system bottlenecks

3. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Verify data consistency
   - Validate transformation logic
   - Check integration points
   - Review validation rules

## Future Development
