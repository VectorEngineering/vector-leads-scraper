# Worker Runner Operations

## Overview
This document outlines the various operations and responsibilities of the worker runner component in the Vector Leads Scraper service. The worker runner is responsible for executing background tasks using Asynq as the task queue system.

## Core Operations

### 1. Scheduled Scraping Jobs
The worker runner manages scheduled scraping tasks from Google Maps:
- Process scheduled scraping tasks at configured intervals
- Handle batch scraping requests for multiple locations
- Manage scraping depth and pagination
- Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies to comply with service limits
- Coordinate parallel scraping jobs efficiently

### 2. Data Processing and Enrichment
Once data is scraped, the worker performs various processing tasks:
- Clean and normalize scraped lead data
- Enrich leads with additional information from other sources
- Validate lead information for accuracy and completeness
- Deduplicate leads to prevent redundant entries
- Format data according to specified schemas and standards

### 3. Database Operations
The worker handles all database-related tasks:
- Batch insert/update of scraped leads for better performance
- Archive old or processed leads based on retention policies
- Update lead status and metadata
- Implement retry logic for failed database operations
- Maintain data consistency across operations

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
Robust error handling is implemented for:
- Scraping failures and automatic retries
- Rate limiting errors from Google Maps
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- Circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted tasks

### 5. Monitoring and Metrics
The worker collects and reports various metrics:
- Success/failure rates of scraping jobs
- Scraping duration and performance metrics
- Lead count and quality metrics
- Resource usage and bottleneck identification
- System health and performance indicators

### 6. Queue Management
Efficient queue management includes:
- Priority-based task processing
- Task scheduling and rescheduling logic
- Management of task dependencies
- Task cancellation and cleanup procedures
- Queue health monitoring

### 7. Notification and Alerts
The worker implements notification systems for:
- Completed scraping job notifications
- Error and failure alerts
- Daily/weekly scraping statistics
- Rate limit warnings and notifications
- System health alerts

### 8. Resource Management
Efficient resource utilization is maintained through:
- Management of concurrent scraping workers
- Memory usage control during large scrapes
- Proxy rotation management (if applicable)
- Session and token refresh handling
- Resource allocation optimization

### 9. Data Export and Integration
The worker facilitates data movement:
- Export processed leads to external systems
- Generate periodic reports and summaries
- Sync data with integrated services
- Handle webhook notifications
- Maintain data pipeline integrity

### 10. Maintenance Tasks
Regular maintenance operations include:
- Cleanup of old task records
- Archival of completed jobs
- Configuration updates
- System health checks
- Performance optimization tasks

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Load balancing across workers
- Resource allocation strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Reliability
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Data consistency guarantees
- Recovery procedures
- Backup and restore capabilities

### Monitoring
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
- Task queue monitoring
- System health checks

### Security
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and authentication
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Secure credential management
- Audit logging

## Configuration

The worker runner can be configured through environment variables and configuration files:

```yaml
worker:
  concurrency: 10
  batch_size: 100
  retry_limit: 3
  retry_delay: 5s
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_second: 5
    burst: 10
  monitoring:
    metrics_interval: 1m
    health_check_interval: 30s
```

## Integration

The worker runner integrates with various system components:

- **Redis**: For task queue management using Asynq
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent storage of lead data
- **New Relic**: For monitoring and performance tracking
- **External APIs**: For data enrichment and validation
- **Notification Systems**: For alerts and updates

## Best Practices

1. **Task Design**
   - Keep tasks small and focused
   - Implement idempotency
   - Include proper error handling
   - Maintain task independence

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Use connection pooling
   - Handle rate limiting

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper retry logic
   - Log errors comprehensively
   - Handle edge cases
   - Maintain audit trails

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track key metrics
   - Set up proper alerting
   - Monitor queue health
   - Track resource usage

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Task Processing Issues**
   - Check Redis connectivity
   - Verify task payload format
