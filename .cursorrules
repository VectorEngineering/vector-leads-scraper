## 2. Planning and Implementing Code Changes

### A. Complex Changes

1. **Plan Before Coding:**
   - **Define Scope:**  
     Break the overall change into smaller tasks. Use flow diagrams or pseudocode to clarify the structure.
   - **Risk Analysis:**  
     Identify potential pitfalls and dependencies; note where additional testing is required.
   - **Documentation:**  
     Prepare a detailed plan or design document that includes the change’s motivation, expected outcomes, and trade-offs.
   - **Approval Process:**  
     Present your plan for review and approval before proceeding with implementation.

2. **Implementation:**
   - **Modular Approach:**  
     Develop in isolated modules or packages, ensuring that each piece can be tested and rolled back if needed.
   - **Iterative Development:**  
     Implement changes in small increments, verifying each step with tests and code reviews.

### B. Simple Changes

- **Direct Implementation:**  
  For minor fixes or enhancements, implement the change directly. However, always think through the impact step-by-step to avoid side effects. Confirm functionality with existing tests.

---

## 3. Code Organization and Refactoring

### A. File Management

- **File Splitting:**  
  If a file becomes too lengthy or covers multiple concerns, split it into smaller files or packages. For example, separate HTTP route handlers, middleware, and utility functions into distinct files.
  
- **Modular Packages:**  
  Organize related functionalities into distinct Go packages. This improves clarity, reusability, and dependency management.

### B. Function Organization

- **Function Splitting:**  
  If a function is too long or complex, break it down into focused helper functions. Each function should perform one well-defined task.
  
- **Error Propagation:**  
  Ensure helper functions propagate errors appropriately, using error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`) to retain context.

---

## 4. Debugging Strategies

### A. Gathering Context

- **Logging and Tracing:**  
  - **Structured Logging:**  
    Use structured logging libraries (e.g., Logrus, Zap) to include contextual information like request IDs, user data, or function names.
  - **Tracing:**  
    Integrate distributed tracing (with tools such as OpenTelemetry) to follow request paths through your system.
  - **Debugging Tools:**  
    Utilize debugging tools like Delve to step through execution and inspect state.

### B. Analyzing the Problem

- **Immediate Fixes:**  
  If logs clearly indicate the source of the problem, implement the fix promptly.
- **Complex Issues:**  
  If the issue is unclear, brainstorm 4–6 potential causes, narrow them down to the 1–2 most likely, and either add more logging for validation or implement a fix once confident in the diagnosis.

---

## 5. Documentation & Reference Materials

- **Using Markdown Files:**  
  When provided with markdown files as references for code structure and style, use them solely as guides. **Do not modify** these files.

- **GoDoc Comments:**  
  Always include comprehensive GoDoc comments for all packages, functions, types, and methods. Provide clear usage examples.

---

## 6. Git and GitHub Workflow

### A. Local Git Workflow

1. **Status Check:**  
   - Run `git status` to identify uncommitted changes.
2. **Staging Changes:**  
   - Stage changes using `git add .` when needed.
3. **Committing:**  
   - Create clear, concise commit messages that explain the changes. For example:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Refactored HTTP handler: split into helper functions and improved error handling"
     ```
4. **Pushing Changes:**  
   - Push your branch to the remote repository using `git push`.
5. **Branch Verification:**  
   - Confirm your branch with `git branch` to ensure you’re not committing to the wrong branch.
6. **Reviewing Changes:**  
   - Review your commit history with `git log main..[current branch]` and check modified files with `git diff --name-status main`.

### B. Creating a Pull Request via GitHub CLI

1. **Prepare Your Code:**  
   - Ensure all tests pass and that the code adheres to repository style guidelines.
2. **Submit PR:**  
   - Use the GitHub CLI to create a PR. For example:  
     ```bash
     gh pr create --title "Refactor HTTP Handlers for Improved Maintainability" --body "Refactored HTTP handler by splitting complex functions, improving error handling, and updating logging for better traceability. This change enhances performance and simplifies future debugging without affecting external behavior."
     ```  
     **Note:** Keep the PR message as one continuous line without newline breaks.

## 7. Golang Best Practices in Detail

### A. Code Formatting & Static Analysis

- **Formatting:**  
  Always run `gofmt` to ensure your code conforms to Go’s formatting standards.
- **Static Analysis:**  
  Use `go vet` and linters (e.g., `golangci-lint`) to catch potential issues early.

### B. Error Handling

- **Idiomatic Error Handling:**  
  Use error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`) to add context.  
  _Example:_
  ```go
  if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
      return fmt.Errorf("doSomething failed: %w", err)
  }
  ```
- **Sentinel Errors:**  
  Define and use sentinel errors for common failure scenarios when appropriate.

### C. Concurrency and Performance

- **Goroutines & Channels:**  
  Manage concurrent operations with care. Use channels and synchronization primitives (mutexes, wait groups) to avoid race conditions.
- **Context Package:**  
  Use `context.Context` for timeouts and cancellation in long-running operations.

### D. Testing & Continuous Integration

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Write thorough tests using Go’s testing framework, aiming for high coverage on critical paths.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Validate that different system parts interact correctly.
- **CI Pipelines:**  
  Integrate tests and linters in a continuous integration pipeline to run on every commit or PR.
